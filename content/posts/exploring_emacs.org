Emacs is like no other piece of software in existence.

In some sense it is simply a text editor. There are many editors out
there, of various degrees of sophisitication, and on some level, Emacs
is just another member of that category. If all you are trying to do
is edit a text file, then Emacs will do the job as well as any
editor. Granted, with Emacs there is a learning curve for even basic
editing tasks. Mark and point? Kill and yank? What is this all about?

If what you are most concerned about is editing configuration files on
a Linux server, then by all means, stick with vi or vim. They are more
likely to be available on any random system you happen to find
yourself on, and have a nice terse set of key strokes
for editing commands.

Once you have the basics of Emacs down, however, you will find it has
much more to offer. Start looking into what Emacs can do, and you will
find any number of rabbit holes to go down, some of them far removed
from what you might think is in scope for an editor. Emacs can be
anything from a calculator to a terminal emulator to a Tetris clone.

It should be pointed out in this inaugural post that I am an Emacs
enthusiast but not an expert. I have been using it for more than a
decade, and feel very comfortable within it, but there is a long way
to go still in understanding and mastering what it is capable of. This
blog is meant as "show and tell", to give me a reason to explore this
labyrinth of an editor, to scurry down one rabbit hole after another
and report on what I find.

Topics that I may address in this blog, in no particular order:

- Emacs history
- Basic usage
- Emacs Lisp programming
- Major and minor mode development
- Fun and games
- Org-mode

If any of that sounds interesting, I hope you are ready to follow along
with me as I go exploring Emacs.
